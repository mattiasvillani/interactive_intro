## Outline of the talk

-   **Tour of some interactive notebooks for Statistics** that I have done for courses and research.

-   **How you can use and modify them** for your needs.

-   **A little under the hood** (Javascript) on how they were done.

## Observable Notebooks

-   Like Quarto/Jupyter: document with

    -   **text** (markdown and html)

    -   **math** (LaTeX)

    -   **code**

    -   **graphs**

    -   **tables**

-   **Interactive** with sliders, checkboxes etc.

-   **Reactive** : change one cell and the cells that depends on the cell changes (DAG-based)

-   Free (version) and wonderful infrastructure for hosting of notebooks on <https://observablehq.com/>

## Nearly 50 Statistical distributions

## Interval estimates

-   [Confidence interval for a proportion](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/confidence-interval-for-a-proportion)

-   [Confidence interval for a mean](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/confidence-interval-for-a-mean)

-   [Bayesian credible intervals](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/bayesian-credible-intervals)

-   [Coverage of intervals](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/coverage-of-confidence-intervals-for-a-proportion)

## The likelihood function and the MLE

-   [Bernoulli](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/maximum-likelihood-bernoulli-data)

-   [Poisson](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/maximum-likelihood-for-iid-poisson-data)

-   [Poisson regression](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/maximum-likelihood-poisson-regression)

## Basic mathematics

-   The [derivative](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/the-derivative)

-   The [Riemann integral](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/the-riemann-integral)

-   [Second derivative measures curvature](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/second-derivative-measures-the-curvature-of-a-function) of a function

## Probability

-   [Approximating the binomial distribution](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/approximating-the-binomial-distribution)

-   [Law of large numbers](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/law-large-numbers)

-   [Central limit theorem](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/central-limit-theorem)

-   [Tails of a distribution](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/distribution-of-the-maximum) (largest order statistic)

-   [Distributions on the unit simplex](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/distributions-on-the-unit-simplex)

-   [Kullback-Leibler divergence between distributions](Kullback-Leibler divergence for continuous distributions)

## And of course lots of Bayes

-   [Bayesian inference list with 35+ notebooks](https://observablehq.com/collection/@mattiasvillani/bayesian-learning)

-   [Bayesian updating for the iid Normal model](https://observablehq.com/@mattiasvillani/bayes-iid-gaussian-known-var)

## The three components of a web page

|          HTML           |             CSS             |           Javascript           |

| What to show (**text**) | How to show it (**design**) | What to do (**interactivity**) |

-   Javascript is the language of the web:

    -   Runs in all major browsers without install

    -   Just-in-time compiled. Pretty quick!

-   [Toy example](https://mattiasvillani.com/interactive_intro/js_example/dawg.html)

## Observable framework

-   [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/): **dashboards** instead of notebooks

-   Examples: [US electricity grid](https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-eia/) \| [interest rates](https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-mortgage-rates/)

-   Example (embryo): [Bayesian Learning dashboard](https://mattiasvillani.observablehq.cloud/bayesian-learning/)

-   Different use case: better placement of multiple elements (graphs, sliders etc) on screen.

-   **Data loaders** from any language, e.g. R, Python, Julia.

    -   Data loaders are *executed at build* time.

    -   Any interactivity in real time still handled by javascript.

-   **It is just code** (not a notebook) = VS code + Git workflow.
