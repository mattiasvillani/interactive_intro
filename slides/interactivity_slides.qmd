## Outline of the talk

-   **Tour of some interactive notebooks for Statistics** that I have done for courses and research.

-   **How you can use and modify them** for your needs.

-   **A little peek under the hood** (Javascript) on how they were done.

## Observable Notebooks

-   Like Quarto/Jupyter: document with

    -   **text** (markdown and html)

    -   **math** (LaTeX)

    -   **code**

    -   **graphs**

    -   **tables**

-   **Interactive** with sliders, checkboxes etc.

-   **Reactive** : change one cell and the cells that depends on the cell changes (DAG-based)

-   Free (version) and wonderful infrastructure for hosting of notebooks on <https://observablehq.com/>

## Nearly 50 Statistical distributions

## The three components of a web page

|          HTML           |             CSS             |           Javascript           |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|

| What to show (**text**) | How to show it (**design**) | What to do (**interactivity**) |

-   Javascript is the language of the web:

    -   Runs in all major browsers without install

    -   Just-in-time compiled. Pretty quick!

-   [Javascript cheat sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/)

-   [Toy example](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/interactive_intro/raw/main/js_example/js_example.zip)

## D3 - javascript library for visualization

-   [D3](https://d3js.org/)

-   Full control, but much more low-level than Observable notebooks.

-   [D3 Examples](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery?utm_source=d3js-org&utm_medium=hero&utm_campaign=try-observable)

## Observable notebooks

-   Builds on the [Plot library](https://observablehq.com/plot/) by the creator of D3.

-   Javascript (almost)

    -   Note: javascript uses zero-based indexing

    -   The **Plot** library is based on the grammar of graphics (ggplot2 in R): 90% of time is setting up the right dataset.

    -   Fundamental data structure is vector of objects (dictionaries).

## Data object in Observable

![](figs/data_object_js.png){fig-align="center" width="1200"}

## Observable framework

-   [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/): **dashboards** instead of notebooks

-   Examples: [US electricity grid](https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-eia/) \| [interest rates](https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-mortgage-rates/)

-   Example (embryo): [Bayesian Learning dashboard](https://mattiasvillani.observablehq.cloud/bayesian-learning/)

-   Different use case: better placement of multiple elements (graphs, sliders etc) on screen.

-   **Data loaders** from any language, e.g. R, Python, Julia.

    -   Data loaders are *executed at build* time.

    -   Any interactivity in real time still handled by javascript.

-   **It is just code** (not a notebook) = VS code + Git workflow.
